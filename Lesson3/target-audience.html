            <h2>Scenarios</h2>
            <ul class="noStyleList">
                <li>1: I want to sign up for a place here for my business I am opening later this year. Where do I go to sign up? What are the eligibility requirements?</li>
                <li>2: Our company needs to connect with another to pull of the promotional stunt we are planning. Who would be a good match? What is their contact information?</li>
                <li>3: I do not own a business. I am in high school, and was told to come look here for a local business to do my report on. What local business would be most interesting to me? How do I browse? Are their pictures and short descriptions?</li>
                <li>4: When I closed my business last year, it was rough. I am over it now though and am starting a new business but noticed my old one is still posted here and I sometimes and contacted for it. Is there a service number I can call, or a help page for stuff like that?</li>
                <li>5: I am curious for a local calendar. Is there a place I can go to see what events are happening between the different organizations of Ogden City? Is it up to date? Do all people know they can post there? Who does post there?</li>
