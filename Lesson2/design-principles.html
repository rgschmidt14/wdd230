            <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
            <h3>Open AI</h3>
            <a href="https://openai.com/">Main page of OpenAI's website</a>

            <p>OpenAI shows a stand up example of Hick's law by being so plain in the number of options available to choose in navigating. Hick's law focuses on the amount of time it takes to make a decision based on how many and how complex of options there are. It is very easy to learn what OpenAI is via their website here.</p>

            <h2>Fitt's Law</h2>
            <h3>Three Square Market</h3>
            <a href="https://32market.com/public/">Main page of 32Market's website</a>

            <p>Three Square Market has a home page that I use weekly. Fitt's law focuses on the amount of time it takes to move from one point to another in interaction. The size of a button and the distance one needs to travel to get their make the biggest difference here. I like this website's homepage (not the rest of the site) because it is very easy to push these big button names, and I rarely miss, even though I tap fast.</p>

            <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
            <h3>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</h3>
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng">Main page of the Church's website</a>
            <img src="https://rgschmidt14.github.io/wdd230/images/IMG_0467.PNG">
            <p>The church does a very good job of putting our savior first. He is almost always the first thing we see, and when He isn't it is often a scene that would lead us to Him. The other menu options are smaller, but still prominent enough to not be missed if you were looking for them. The Visual Hierarchy law states that certain contrasts will catch our attention first, and others next. The Church of Jesus Chirst of Latter-day Saints has proved a working knowledge of this by putting such large images of people, with smaller captions (that are still quite legible) of text. This shows that we can first look by image, and later if we decide, by titles too. Great Hierarchy, thank you.</p>
